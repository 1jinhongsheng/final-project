# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Monster Quest
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Python-based text adventure RPG in the style of Pokemon

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project is a Python-based text adventure RPG, similar to Pok√©mon. Players will play the role of monster trainers, explore and capture monsters in the area, and engage in turn-based battles. The game supports map movement, monster capture, item management, etc.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Just my self

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Allow players to capture monsters and join their team

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Design multiple map areas, each with different monsters and challenges

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Added save and load functions so players can save their progress

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Design monster data structure
